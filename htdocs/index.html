<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<dl>
	<dt>Do I need to bring my own equipment?</dt>
	<dd>
		No. We have jackets, gloves, helmets and sabres available in a range of sizes.
		You will want to bring comfortable supportive sneakers for the best experience.
		If you have your own gear, you are welcome to bring it of course.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>Are children welcome?</dt>
	<dd>
		We actively encourage children learning to fence. We have participants as young as 8 years old.
		There are fencing programmes offered through some of the schools, and this can be a nice supplement to
		that. During the school summer vacation we generally see lower attendance of children.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>I've never fenced before, is it dangerous?</dt>
	<dd>
		No. You are just as likely to be injured in any other sport as with fencing.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>Do you offer lessons?</dt>
	<dd>
		Most nights feature some form of instruction. For beginners there is usually a private or semi-private
		lesson given the first night to introduce some of the basics. We try to mix the beginners and more
		intermediate students together so that newcomers are brought up to speed relatively quickly in a fun
		not-overly-competitive environment.
